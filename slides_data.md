## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Maker/Checker Problem (Your Main Concern)
- **Slide 8**: "A Beforest Opportunity" - Positions Beforest as both identifying opportunities AND being a fund partner
- **Slide 9**: Prominently features Beforest logo as implementer
- **Slide 20**: Shows Beforest results as proof of concept
- **Slide 25**: Describes what "Beforest sets up" 
- **Slide 30**: Lists Beforest's advisors and collaborations

**Problem**: The deck makes it appear that Beforest is both:
- The entity proposing/creating the fund (maker)
- A partner who would benefit from fund investments (checker)

### 2. Real Estate vs. Environmental Positioning
**Current Real Estate Signals**:
- Focus on "Living Spaces" and "Hospitality" in Slide 9
- "Economic Zone" emphasis in Slide 10
- "300% return over 3 years" prominently featured in Slide 20
- Multiple references to property development and economic returns

**Environmental Mission Signals**:
- Strong environmental problem setup (Slides 2-3)
- Soil regeneration focus (Slide 4)
- 4 Returns Framework (Slides 5-6)
- Conservation and restoration emphasis

**Problem**: Mixed signals could attract real estate investors looking for property returns rather than mission-driven environmental investors.

### 3. Global Impact Vision Gap
- Limited global scale perspective
- Focus primarily on Indian examples and local impact
- Missing broader planetary transformation narrative
- Lacks connection to global climate and sustainability goals

## OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. **Reposition Beforest Role**: Clarify whether Beforest is fund manager, implementation partner, or both - avoid conflict appearance
2. **Strengthen Environmental Mission**: Lead with planetary impact, position real estate as means not end
3. **Add Global Context**: Connect local solutions to global climate crisis and UN SDGs
4. **Filter Investor Type**: Add language that specifically appeals to impact investors vs. property developers
