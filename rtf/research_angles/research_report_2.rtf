\fs32\b Research Report 2: Solar Power Fund Positioning vs. Real Estate Fund Messaging\b0\fs24\par
\par
\fs28\b Executive Summary\b0\fs24\par
This research analyzes the critical differences between solar infrastructure fund messaging and real estate fund positioning to help transform the current pitch deck from mixed signals into clear environmental infrastructure positioning that attracts mission-driven investors.\par
\par
\fs28\b Critical Issues Identified in Current Pitch Deck\b0\fs24\par
\par
\fs26\b Real Estate Red Flags Currently Present:\b0\fs24\par
\bullet \b "Economic Zone" emphasis\b0 on "living spaces, hospitality" (Slide 10)\par
\bullet \b "Multiuse landscapes"\b0 language suggesting property development\par
