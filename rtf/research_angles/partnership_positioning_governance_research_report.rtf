\fs32\b Research Angle 6: Partnership Positioning in Environmental Fund Governance\b0\fs24\par
\par
\b Date:\b0 August 21, 2025\par
\b Focus:\b0 Resolving Maker/Checker Contradiction in Green Fund Governance Structure\par
\par

\par
\fs28\b Executive Summary\b0\fs24\par
\par
Based on comprehensive research of 2025 environmental fund governance best practices, this report provides frameworks to resolve the critical "maker/checker" contradiction where Beforest appears as both the fund proposer (maker) and a benefiting implementation partner (checker). The research reveals established governance structures that maintain fund independence while leveraging partner expertise through transparent disclosure and oversight mechanisms.\par

\fs28\b Current Issue Analysis\b0\fs24\par
\par
\fs26\b The Maker/Checker Contradiction Identified\b0\fs24\par
\par
From the pitch deck analysis, the following contradictory positioning emerges:\par
\par
\b Beforest as "Maker" (Fund Creator):\b0\par
\bullet Slide 8: "A Beforest Opportunity" - positioning as fund originator\par
\bullet Slide 9: Beforest logo prominently displayed on "Design for the Land" implementation approach\par
\bullet Slide 11: "Beforest Approach" - positioning as strategy developer\par
\bullet Slide 27: Sunith Reddy presented as "Founder and CEO, Beforest"\par
\par
\b Beforest as "Checker" (Implementation Beneficiary):\b0\par
\bullet Beforest positioned to benefit from fund investments through implementation services\par
\bullet Direct involvement in project execution creates potential conflicts of interest\par
\bullet Lack of independent oversight mechanisms clearly defined\par
\par
This structure raises concerns about:\par
\bullet Fund independence and fiduciary responsibility\par
\bullet Transparency in partner selection processes\par
\bullet Investor protection from conflicts of interest\par
\bullet Regulatory compliance with 2025 governance standards\par
\par
