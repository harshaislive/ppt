\bullet A partner who would benefit from fund investments (checker)\par
\par
\fs26\b 2. Real Estate vs. Environmental Positioning\b0\fs24\par
\b Current Real Estate Signals\b0:\par
\bullet Focus on "Living Spaces" and "Hospitality" in Slide 9\par
\bullet "Economic Zone" emphasis in Slide 10\par

\bullet Multiple references to property development and economic returns\par
\par
\b Environmental Mission Signals\b0:\par

\bullet Soil regeneration focus (Slide 4)\par
\bullet 4 Returns Framework (Slides 5-6)\par
\bullet Conservation and restoration emphasis\par
\par
\b Problem\b0: Mixed signals could attract real estate investors looking for property returns rather than mission-driven environmental investors.\par
\par
\fs26\b 3. Global Impact Vision Gap\b0\fs24\par
\bullet Limited global scale perspective\par
\bullet Focus primarily on Indian examples and local impact\par

\par

\par
\b Reposition Beforest Role\b0: Clarify whether Beforest is fund manager, implementation partner, or both - avoid conflict appearance\par
\b Strengthen Environmental Mission\b0: Lead with planetary impact, position real estate as means not end\par
\b Add Global Context\b0: Connect local solutions to global climate crisis and UN SDGs\par
\b Filter Investor Type\b0: Add language that specifically appeals to impact investors vs. property developers\par
