\fs32\b Beforest Research Report\b0\fs24\par
\par
\fs28\b Executive Summary\b0\fs24\par
\par
Beforest.co is an innovative Indian startup founded in 2018 that creates forest-friendly collectives focused on regenerative agriculture and land restoration. Based on both their investor presentation data and comprehensive online research, Beforest operates a unique collective ownership model combining sustainable farming, biodiversity conservation, and community living across 700+ acres in 6 collectives. The company represents a compelling investment opportunity in the regenerative agriculture space with quantifiable environmental and financial returns.\par
\par
\fs28\b Company Overview\b0\fs24\par
\par
\fs26\b Business Model\b0\fs24\par
Beforest creates forest-friendly collectives to restore natural balance lost due to decades of deforestation, conventional monoculture farming, urbanization, and fast culture. Their core model includes:\par
\par
\bullet \b Collective Ownership Structure\b0: Crowdfunded and co-owned by member-led communities\par
\bullet \b Legal Framework\b0: Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) model where members are land owners and Beforest is the enabler\par
\bullet \b Scale Requirements\b0: All collectives start with 100+ acres minimum\par
\bullet \b Revenue Model\b0: Takes 25% of farm revenue over agreed time periods\par
\par
\fs26\b The Problem They Address\b0\fs24\par
According to their presentation data, in just 5 decades:\par
\bullet \b 61% of forest cover has disappeared\b0 in Central and South India\par
\bullet \b 90% average loss of soil carbon content\b0\par
\bullet \b 2.1M litres of water access lost per acre\b0\par
\par
This represents "The Tragedy of Commons" - ecosystem services like clean water, clean air, abundant grasslands, and waste water recycling have historically been considered free and infinite, but are no longer. These costs must now be included in business models.\par
