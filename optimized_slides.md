## SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE
**Investment Note**
# GREEN FUND
*Regenerative Agriculture Infrastructure Investment*

**Footer:** PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL | 01

**Research Sources & Justification:** Title positioning derived from Research Report 2 recommendations to avoid real estate development language and emphasize "renewable energy infrastructure development" and "clean energy transition acceleration." The "Infrastructure Investment" subtitle addresses the critical issue identified in Report 2 of mixed messaging between solar/renewable energy funds and real estate development funds, positioning this clearly as environmental infrastructure rather than property development.

## SLIDE 2: THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS 
**Subtitle:** In just 5 decades

# 61%
**Of forest cover has disappeared in Central and South India**

**Additional Metrics:**
- 90% average loss of soil carbon content  
- 2.1M litres of water access lost per acre

**Footer:** PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL | 02

**Research Sources & Justification:** Environmental crisis data sourced from Beforest Research Report (beforest_research.md lines 18-22). These specific metrics (61% forest cover loss, 90% soil carbon loss, 2.1M litres water access loss per acre) are directly from Beforest's investor presentation data, providing credible third-party validation of the environmental problem being addressed. This establishes the quantifiable scale of environmental degradation that the fund's regenerative agriculture approach aims to reverse.

## SLIDE 3: REVERSING THE CYCLE - WHY?
# Reversing the Cycle
**WHY?**

## The Tragedy of Commons
Ecosystem services like clean water, clean air, abundant grasslands, waste water recycling, have historically been considered free of cost and infinite. They are not anymore. We have to include these costs in our business models.

**Footer:** PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL | 03

**Research Sources & Justification:** "Tragedy of Commons" framework sourced from Beforest Research Report (beforest_research.md lines 23-24) and original slide content (slide3.html lines 255-262). This economic argument addresses Research Report 1's emphasis on "Geopolitical Supply Chain Resilience Investing" by positioning environmental restoration as essential infrastructure rather than optional enhancement, aligning with the fund's infrastructure-scale positioning.

## SLIDE 4: REVERSING THE CYCLE - HOW?
# Reversing the Cycle
**HOW?**

## Great Soil - The Silver Bullet
Soil is one of the fundamental resources needed for life. Every 1% increase in soil carbon content can:

• **Sequester all carbon emissions of last 40 years**
• **Provide 700,000 litres of additional water access per acre**

**Footer:** PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL | 04

**Research Sources & Justification:** Soil carbon benefits sourced from Beforest Research Report (beforest_research.md lines 117-120) and original slide content (slide4.html lines 296-310). These specific quantified benefits (40 years carbon sequestration, 700,000 litres water access) provide the scientific foundation for the investment thesis, supported by Regenerative Agriculture Investment Analysis 2025 which emphasizes soil carbon as the primary value creation mechanism in regenerative agriculture investments.
