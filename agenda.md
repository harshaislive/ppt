# Green Fund Pitch Deck Optimization Agenda

## Core Goal
Transform the pitch deck to attract mission-driven solar power investors, not real estate investors who just see property deals.

## Key Concerns to Address

### 1. Maker/Checker Contradiction
Avoid positioning Beforest as both the maker (creating/proposing the fund) AND the checker (partner who evaluates/approves it). This creates a conflict of interest perception that could undermine credibility with investors.

### 2. Global Impact Vision
Showcase the big picture transformation and planetary impact this fund will create long-term, not just focus on fundraising mechanics. Show investors the meaningful global change they're enabling.

### 3. Investor Type Filter
Repel real estate-minded investors who'd ask property-focused questions, and attract impact investors who care about solar power advancing the planet's future.

### 4. Positioning Shift
Transform from "real estate fund that happens to do solar" to "solar transformation fund that uses real estate as the vehicle."

## Target Outcome
Position the fund to attract investors who prioritize environmental mission and solar power advancement over property returns.
