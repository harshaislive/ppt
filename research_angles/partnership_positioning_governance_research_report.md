# Research Angle 6: Partnership Positioning in Environmental Fund Governance

**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Focus:** Resolving Maker/Checker Contradiction in Green Fund Governance Structure

---

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research of 2025 environmental fund governance best practices, this report provides frameworks to resolve the critical "maker/checker" contradiction where Beforest appears as both the fund proposer (maker) and a benefiting implementation partner (checker). The research reveals established governance structures that maintain fund independence while leveraging partner expertise through transparent disclosure and oversight mechanisms.

## Current Issue Analysis

### The Maker/Checker Contradiction Identified

From the pitch deck analysis, the following contradictory positioning emerges:

**Beforest as "Maker" (Fund Creator):**
- Slide 8: "A Beforest Opportunity" - positioning as fund originator
- Slide 9: Beforest logo prominently displayed on "Design for the Land" implementation approach
- Slide 11: "Beforest Approach" - positioning as strategy developer
- Slide 27: Sunith Reddy presented as "Founder and CEO, Beforest"

**Beforest as "Checker" (Implementation Beneficiary):**
- Beforest positioned to benefit from fund investments through implementation services
- Direct involvement in project execution creates potential conflicts of interest
- Lack of independent oversight mechanisms clearly defined

This structure raises concerns about:
- Fund independence and fiduciary responsibility
- Transparency in partner selection processes
- Investor protection from conflicts of interest
- Regulatory compliance with 2025 governance standards
