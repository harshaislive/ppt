# Research Report 6: Partnership Positioning in Environmental Fund Governance (2025)

## Executive Summary
This research addresses the critical "maker/checker" contradiction in the current pitch deck where Beforest appears as both fund creator and implementation partner. The report provides governance frameworks that resolve this conflict while maintaining Beforest's strategic value through appropriate positioning as advisory partner and qualified implementation entity.

## Problem Analysis: The Maker/Checker Contradiction

### Current Conflicting Positioning:
**As Fund Maker (Creator Role):**
- Slide 8: "A Beforest Opportunity" - positions as fund originator
- Slide 9: Prominent Beforest logo - suggests fund ownership/creation
- Slide 25: "Beforest sets up..." - describes as fund implementer/creator

**As Fund Checker (Beneficiary Role):**
- Slide 20: Beforest track record as proof of concept
- Slide 30: Beforest advisors and collaborations
- Position as implementation partner who would receive fund investments

### Investor Risk Perception:
- **Conflict of interest**: Same entity creating and benefiting from fund
- **Lack of independence**: No objective partner evaluation
- **Governance concerns**: Self-dealing potential without oversight
- **Regulatory compliance**: Potential violations of fiduciary duty standards

## 2025 Regulatory and Market Requirements

### Enhanced Governance Standards:
- **Corporate Transparency Act (2024)**: Beneficial ownership disclosure requirements
- **ESG Disclosure Standards**: Enhanced transparency for environmental funds
- **Fiduciary Duty Evolution**: Stricter conflict-of-interest prevention
- **Investor Protection Focus**: Independent oversight mechanisms mandatory

### Market Best Practices (2025):
- **Independent fund management**: Separation from implementation partners
- **Competitive partner selection**: Transparent evaluation processes
- **Governance frameworks**: Clear conflict resolution mechanisms
- **Third-party oversight**: Independent advisory and evaluation structures

## Governance Structure Solutions
